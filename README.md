trying to have some competition with steam due the price thing on Argentina and Türkye (Turkey) to put their currency insted of the USD. This project have been started in Mexico (On the state of Nuevo Léon) and Argentina (On the province of Buenos Aires (Capital of Argentina)) to do this we (me and conejo verde) will need to learn programming s*** so it have a good perfomance to run on Windows and Linux (If possible).
## NOTE: THIS IS REGISTED AS AMERICAN BEACUSE IS FREE THERE TO DO A SMALL BUISSNES. WE CANNOT DO THAT ON MEXICO OR ARGENTINA DUE THE FEE TO REGISTER IT
